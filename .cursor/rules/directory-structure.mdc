# Directory Structure and Context Management

## Core Directory Structure
- The project is organized with specific directories for different components
- The main backend code is located in `stableflow-Backend` directory
- All commands should be executed from the appropriate directory context

## Command Execution Guidelines
- Always verify the current working directory before executing commands
- Commands related to the backend must be run from within the `stableflow-Backend` directory
- When switching between tasks, explicitly change directories as needed
- For running tests, make sure to be inside the `stableflow-Backend` directory

## Directory Change Protocol
1. Before executing any command, verify current directory with `pwd`
2. If working on backend features, ensure you're in `stableflow-Backend`
3. When moving between components, use explicit `cd` commands
4. After directory changes, verify the change was successful

## Common Directory Paths
- Backend root: `/Users/seyi.idowu/Desktop/stableflow/stableflow-Backend`
- Frontend root: `/Users/seyi.idowu/Desktop/stableflow/stableflow-Frontend` (if applicable)
- Project root: `/Users/seyi.idowu/Desktop/stableflow`

## Testing Commands
- All backend test commands must be run from `stableflow-Backend` directory
- Always use the complete command path (e.g., `yarn test:all`) from the correct directory
- Never run test commands from the project root as they won't be found

## Directory Context Checking
- Always include directory context in command explanations
- Verify directory context before each terminal command
- If a command fails, first check if you're in the correct directory
