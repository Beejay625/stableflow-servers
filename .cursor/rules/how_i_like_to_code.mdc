# Coding workflow preferences
-   Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
-   Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
-   Write thorough tests for all major functionality
-   Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly structed
-   Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes 
How I like to documentation   # documentation preference     - Document every major feature in a dedicated file.
- Store docs in /docs inside each module for organization.
- Use {featurename}.md (e.g., ticket-lifecycle.md).
- Update docs with any feature changes to keep them current.
- No feature should be undocumented—cover everything.
